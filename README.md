# Giphy-GraphQL
A GraphQL wrapper around [Giphy's API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/).

# Usage
In the project's root directory, make a file called config.json and make it look like this:
```javascript 
{
"GIPHY_KEY": "PUT-YOUR-GIPHY-API-KEY-HERE"
}
```
Get a Giphy API key [here](https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/?create=true).

Then install the dependencies:
``` npm install ```

After you have completed the above steps you can start the server with: ```npm start```

Then open http://localhost:4000/ in your browser and you should see this: ![](https://i.imgur.com/QvvrJW4.jpg)
